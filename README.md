# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_

# Experimental Design
Define the question, the metric for success, understanding the context and recording the experimental design.

Import the libraries, loading data, read the data and image pre processing the images.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Image pre_processing which included:(i) Reshaping of the images.

                                (ii) Reading all the images and converting them into an array of labels and features.
                                (iii) Shuffling the images to be picked at random to avoid overfitting.
                                (iv) Normalizing the pixels of the images.
Build the model using Convolutional Neural Networks.

Challenging the solution.
